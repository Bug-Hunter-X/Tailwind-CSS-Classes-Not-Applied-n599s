# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly.  The example shows a simple div with the `bg-red-500` class, which should produce a red background. However, the class fails to apply due to a problem in the Tailwind CSS configuration or build process.  The solution provided addresses this specific issue, but it serves as a guide for troubleshooting similar problems. This bug usually arises from incorrect content paths, improper build processes, or conflicts within the CSS structure.
